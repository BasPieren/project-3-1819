## Description 📝
For this project we where asked to help out some students form software engineering with their project in collaboration with [CERN](https://home.cern/), the European Organization for Nuclear Research. They are making a dashboard for [ALICE](https://home.cern/science/experiments/alice) (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) which displays data like their logs and runs. They asked us to help out with some of their user stories. I choose the following user story (in Dutch):

> (O2B-100) ALS Gebruiker WIL IK op al mijn devices een intuïtieve webapplicatie kunnen gebruiken ZODAT Ik door alle opgeslagen metadata kan zoeken.

I choose to make a redesign of the [runs](http://cmd.jiskefet.io/runs?pageSize=16&pageNumber=1) page and create a basic prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The focus was to create a better mobile webpage.
